# My-first-car with SBrick

Relatively simple car controlled by SBrick. Uses the [sbrick.js](https://github.com/360fun/sbrick.js) library

## Lego setup

Create a Lego car with a SBrick:
- Driven by a motor (on port BOTTOMLEFT)
- With a distance/motion sensor (on port BOTTOMRIGHT) mounted on a
- Servo motor (on port TOPRIGHT)

the motion sensor should point up, and will be turned forward/backward when the car drives

(You can see my version in the folder _lego-pictures_)

## Software

The software has to be hosted on a secure (https) server (That's a requirement for using the Web Bluetooth API)
